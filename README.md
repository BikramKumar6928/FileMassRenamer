This application changes the name of mentioned number of files having name in the format "(string).(file_extension)","(string)_2.(file_extension)","(string)_3.(file_extension)"...
This is the default format in Windows 10 of saving files having the same name in the same directory(folder).
The application changes the name to "(new_string).(file_extension)","(new_string)_2.(file_extension)","(new_string)_3.(file_extension)"... 
Thus allowing for future name change.
